# [Blueprint](http://blueprintjs.com/) Date & Time Components (V2)

Blueprint is a React UI toolkit for the web.

This package contains re-exports of components from `@blueprintjs/datetime`. The "V3" components previously existed in this package as of v5.x, but they were promoted to the standard "V1" components in `@blueprintjs/datetime` v6.x.

This package also contains legacy APIs which are re-exported aliases for components from @blueprintjs/datetime v5.x. These "V2" names are backwards-compatible with @blueprintjs/datetime2 v0.x.

To migrate to the latest "V3" components, follow the [react-day-picker v8 migration guide](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/wiki/react-day-picker-8-migration).
